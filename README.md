# Stack Machine
The "Stack Machine" project in C is an implementation of a stack machine aimed at enhancing and demonstrating skills in C programming. This stack machine is a simple virtual machine that operates on a computational model where all operations are executed using a data structure known as a stack.

The stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that operates under the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, where the last element inserted is the first to be removed. In the context of the stack machine, the stack is used to store operands and results of operations.

In summary, the "Stack Machine" project in C provides a valuable opportunity to enhance C programming skills while gaining a deeper understanding of fundamental data structures and computational operations.
